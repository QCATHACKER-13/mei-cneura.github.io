# MEI-CNEURA
CNEURA as start up project for a trained artificial neuron, neural layer, and network research studies. I vision of a pure C/C++ development machine learning algorithm for a low level, and low powered programming. For now the research studies are ongoing, possibility and feasibility in embedded and old devices.

MEI stands for Machine Emulation Intelligence. A machine intelligence that learns to emulate the process of physics simulation itself, incorporating numerical methods and probabilistic logic to represent, adapt, and predict physical systems more efficiently or more robustly than traditional simulators. As specialized for probabilistic computation and simulation. A computational architecture wherein intelligent systems emulate physical processes and their numerical computation schemes, integrating probabilistic modeling and uncertainty reasoning to perform adaptive, efficient, and robust simulation or inference of physical phenomena.

For now, each versions is code documentation progress and history, if there is some
